Repo for CRT Genomic Data Science student led group learning

One Directory per topic. Each participating student is encouraged upload a script (in whatever language) demonstrating what they personally learned about the topic along the way.

When contributing a script we will try to follow a file naming convention in order to keep track of who submitted what. Lastname_Firstname.extension (?)

Resources Directory will be used to collect Cheat Sheets and tutorials that people found relevant to their learning.

A new topic will be tackled for approximately two weeks each. 

## Book 1: The Elements of Statistical Learning
The first book to be tackled as a group is The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman.
